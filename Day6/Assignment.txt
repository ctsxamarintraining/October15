4. Using .Net provided List<T> and Dictionary<Tkey,TValue>, perform operations for Add,AddRange, Remove, Contains, InsertAt, Clear.

5. Implement IEqualityComparer and IComparer for any custom class and give an example for both interfaces by using any of the default classes/methods in .NET which are accepting these interfaces.
